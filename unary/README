finalunary.m computes the final unary term after jointly predict the geometric and semantic label

geometricpotential.m projects the initial region-based geometric uanry potential to pixel-wise and then maps to the new superpixel we generate

jointlabel.m train a multiclass logistic classifier for jointly inference

trainTestSurfaceContestScript.m trains a classifier for geometric label
